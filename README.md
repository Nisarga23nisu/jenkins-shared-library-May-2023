Jenkins Shared Library

Jenkins Shared Library is the way of having a common pipeline code in the version control system which is git that can be called by any number of pipeline jobs just by referring to it in the pipeline code using @Library("<library_name>")_

Steps to setup Jenkins Shared Library

1. Create a git repo for shared library 

     - Create a folder by name vars 

2. Create .groovy file inside vars folder and put shared library code here 
   - Make sure to remember and provide a meaningful name for groovy 
   - Groovy filename is used as the function call

3. Integrated it with Jenkins 
   - Manage Jenkins > System > Global Pipeline Libraries
          Name - Can give any name, we can call it in any job using this @Library("<name>")_
          Default Version - git branch in which we keep our shared library 
          Retrieval method - Modren SCM 
          Source Code Management - Git

4. To call a shared library function / Groovy script 
   - use the name of the script in the pipeline job (Jenkinsfile)
       example: 
               gitCheckout('main',
                           'itd_jenkins', 
                           'https://github.com/jaintpharsha/Devops-ITD-May-2023.git')
